Run the notebook `route_distribution_and_match_by_origin.ipynb` to obtain a directory of csv files that are organized by the first two letters of the ICAO code. The idea is to convert the `matched_filtered_data` to files like `LF.csv` that contains all flights taking off from France. This will help Silverdrizzle to avoid costly overheads when batch generating gml graphs.
